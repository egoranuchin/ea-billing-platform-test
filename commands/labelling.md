# Labelling Emails

This guide explains how to apply a label to an email with voice commands.

1. After reading an email or while viewing an email in your inbox, say, “Label this email as [label name].”
    * Example: “Label this email as Work.”
2. Google will confirm that the label has been applied.
3. You can also create new labels by saying, “Create label [label name],” and then assign it to the email.
