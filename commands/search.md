# Searching for Emails

Use this guide to search for specific emails using Google Voice Command.

1. Say, “*OK Google*” or “*Hey Google*” to activate the voice assistant.
2. Say, “*Search for emails from [sender’s name]*” or “*Search emails about [topic]*.”
    * Example: “*Search for emails from John*” or “*Search emails about the budget.*”
3. Google will retrieve the relevant emails and list them for you. You can ask Google to read any of them by saying, “*Read the first email*” or “*Read the email from [sender].*”
