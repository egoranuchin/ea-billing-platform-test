# Switching the Inbox

If you have multiple Gmail accounts, use this guide to switch between them.

1. Say “Switch to my [account type] inbox.”
    * Example: “Switch to my work inbox” or “Switch to my personal inbox.”
2. Google will switch to the specified account, and you can continue managing emails in that account with voice commands.
