# Voice Command Release Notes 

## Release Date: 10/09/24

We’re excited to announce the release of Google Voice Command for Gmail, a powerful new feature that allows users to manage their email entirely through voice commands. This hands-free functionality makes composing, sending, and organizing emails easier and more efficient than ever. Whether you’re multitasking or prefer a more accessible way to interact with your inbox, Google Voice Command is here to help.

### Key Features

- Compose and Send Emails via Voice: Simply say “Compose email to [recipient]” to begin drafting an email, and “Send email” when you’re ready to send it.
- Inbox Navigation: Use commands like “Read my latest email” or “Show my inbox” to manage your messages without lifting a finger.
- Advanced Email Management: Label and prioritize your emails with voice commands such as “Label this email as [label]” and “Mark this email as important.”
- Hands-Free Search: Find specific emails by saying “Search for emails from [sender]” or “Find emails about [subject].”

### Improvements

- Enhanced Voice Recognition: We’ve improved our natural language processing (NLP) to better understand a wider variety of commands and dialects, ensuring smoother email management.
- Faster Response Times: Email actions are now executed more quickly, providing real-time results after each command.

### Bug Fixes

- Resolved an Issue with Unresponsive Commands: Fixed a bug where certain voice commands were not being recognized or executed in low network conditions.
- Fixed Email Labeling: Addressed an issue where labeling commands (“Label this email as Work”) did not apply the correct labels in some cases.
- Improved Email Search: Refined the search functionality to better interpret and process complex search queries for more accurate results.

We hope you enjoy the convenience and productivity boost that Google Voice Command brings to your Gmail experience. As always, we welcome your feedback to help us improve!
