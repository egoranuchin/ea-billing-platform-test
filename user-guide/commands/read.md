## Reading Emails

Follow these steps to have Google read your most recent email.

1. Say “*OK Google*” or “*Hey Google*” to activate the voice assistant.
2. Say, “*Read my latest email.*”
3. Google will read the sender’s name, the subject, and the body of the most recent email in your inbox.
4. After reading, you can reply, archive, or delete the email using voice commands such as:
    - “*Reply to this email*”
    - “*Archive this email*”
    - “*Delete this email*”
