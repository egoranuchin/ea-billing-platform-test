## Replying an Email

Use this guide to reply to an email using voice commands:

1. While reading an email, say, “*Reply to this email.*”
2. Google will ask for your message. Dictate your reply (e.g., “*Thank you for the update, I’ll follow up soon.*”).
3. When finished, Google will confirm your message and ask if you’re ready to send it.
4. Say, “*Send email*” to send your reply, or say “*Cancel*” to discard it.
