## Marking Emails as Important

Follow these steps to mark an email as important for future reference:

1. After [reading](https://egoranuchin.github.io/ea-billing-platform-test/user-guide/commands/read.html) an email, say, “*Mark this email as important.*”
2. Google will confirm that the email has been marked as important.
3. You can check your important emails later by saying, “*Show my important emails.*”
