## Composing an Email

Use this guide to compose an email hands-free with Google Voice Command.

1. Say “*OK Google*” or “*Hey Google*” to activate voice commands.
2. Say, “*Compose email to [recipient’s name or email address]*.”
3. Google will confirm the recipient. You can add more recipients by saying “*Add [name] to the email.*”
4. After confirming the recipients, Google will prompt you for the subject. Say, “*The subject is [subject line].*”
5. Google will then ask for the email body. Dictate the body of your message. Example: “*The message is: Hi John, just checking in about the project.*”
6. Once you’ve finished, Google will ask if you’re ready to send.
7. To send the email, say “*Send email.*”
8. If you need to review or make changes, say “*Edit email*” to revise the content before sending.
9. If you want to save the email as a draft, say “*Save to Drafts*”.
