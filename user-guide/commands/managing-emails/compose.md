## Composing an Email

Use this guide to compose an email hands-free with Google Voice Command.

	1.	Say “OK Google” or “Hey Google” to activate voice commands.
	2.	Say, “Compose email to [recipient’s name or email address].”
	3.	Google will confirm the recipient. You can add more recipients by saying “Add [name] to the email.”
	4.	After confirming the recipients, Google will prompt you for the subject. Say, “The subject is [subject line].”
	5.	Google will then ask for the email body. Dictate the body of your message. Example: “The message is: Hi John, just checking in about the project.”
	6.	Once you’ve finished, Google will ask if you’re ready to send.
	7.	To send the email, say “Send email.”
	8.	If you need to review or make changes, say “Edit email” to revise the content before sending.



	1.	After dictating your email, Google will prompt you by saying, “Do you want to send the email?”
