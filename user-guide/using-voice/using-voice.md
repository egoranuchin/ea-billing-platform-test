# Activating Voice Commands

Once Google Voice Command is set up, you can start managing your Gmail inbox using voice commands. The feature supports a wide range of commands for composing, sending, and organizing emails, as well as managing your inbox with advanced email controls. To start using the Voice Command:

1. Activate Voice Command by saying “*OK Google*” or “*Hey Google*,” or by taping the microphone icon from the Main View.
