**Voice Command** is a hands-free feature that allows users to compose, send, and manage emails via voice commands. Powered by the latest voice recognition technology, users can dictate email content, navigate their inbox, and perform tasks like replying, forwarding, archiving, and deleting emails -- all without typing or using a keyboard.

### Key Features

1. **Voice-Activated Email Composition**: Users can start composing emails by dictating the recipient, subject, and body of the message. For example, say “Write an email to [recipient]” to begin the email creation process.
2. **Email Management via Voice**: With commands like “Show my unread emails” or “Delete this email,” users can efficiently manage their inbox hands-free.
3. **Voice Commands for Sending and Replying**: After composing an email, a simple “Send email” command will dispatch the message. Users can also reply to or forward emails with simple commands, such as "Reply to this email" or "Forward this email to [recipient]".
4. **Seamless Navigation**: Users can navigate through their inbox, and search for specific emails, using intuitive voice commands like “Search for emails from [sender]” or “Open my [notifications] inbox.”

### Use Cases

* Accessibility for users with physical impairments;
* Hands-free email management while multitasking;
* Improved productivity for users who prefer voice input over typing.

This feature aims to enhance the user experience by streamlining email interactions, making it easier and more convenient for users to stay on top of their communications.
